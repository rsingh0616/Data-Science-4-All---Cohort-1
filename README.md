# Impact of Ad Spending on U.S Presidential Election Outcomes

Advertising spending for candidates running for federal office has reached unprecedented amounts, totaling at least $2.5 billion on TV ads so far (PBS, 2020). New political election spending projections for 2020 will now hit $10.8 billion, according to an estimate from the Center for Responsive Politicsâ€”50% higher than the 2016 presidential election period (MediaPost, 2020). Advertising spending does not inherently indicate who will win any election. For instance, although Hillary Clinton spent $1,184.1M for the 2016 presidential election, she did not win more electoral votes than Donald Trump although he only spent $616.5M (Bloomberg, 2016).

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Political campaign spending has been increasing over time, making it increasingly important for political candidates to allocate funds effectively. The key questions we hope to answer are: 1) how effective is presidential ad spending at influencing voting outcomes; and 2) how does this ad spending vary in effectiveness based on the location?

## PROJECT DEFINITION AND SCOPE
With optimal marketing strategies, presidential candidates will be able to better market their campaigns in a way that translates to votes, allocating their marketing budget in a way that reaches the audiences most critical to the success of presidential candidates. We also anticipate that this can inform presidential campaigns about where marketing spend would be ideal for the success of their campaigns.
